# Calorie Counter made in JavaScript
### Every animation was made by myself and I'm proud of it

To calculate PPM I used Harrisâ€“Benedict equation
I used font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

If you want to to test it do it [here](https://barmcoovy.github.io/calorieCounter/)

Enjoy ;)
